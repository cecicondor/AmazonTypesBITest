explain:

I used a dataset from Kaggle (by: JOAKIM ARVIDSSON) whose purpose seems to show us the most popular books from Amazon.com, off course my goal
is lear more data in a Power BI vision, tryin not to make something visually good, but something that makes the analyst understand wich action 
is the best in this scenario.

1.1 first of all i separated the vision into more contemplated and less contemplated books
1.2 then I did a simple formula IF at DAX ambience just to separate "More than 12k reviews" from "less tha 12k reviews" -> see below:

-- Review2 = IF(Amazon_popular_books_dataset[reviews_count]>12000,"More Than 12k", "Less than 12k")
